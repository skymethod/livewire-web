*This is an archived version, the current version is [here](/podcast-cdns-by-episode-share/).*

In our third and final installment observing the current state of the podcast world, as measured by number of new episodes produced in May 2025, 
we wanted to take a look at which underlying CDNs serve which episodes, and which podcast hosting companies use which network.

*See our earlier analyses of [podcast hosts by episode share](/podcast-hosts-by-episode-share) and [podcast trackers by episode share](/podcast-trackers-by-episode-share)*

In general, every podcast episode has a single url that tells the podcast client app what to play.  However, this episode-level
url might redirect several times in the course a single download request, through various first and third-party trackers, before
ultimately landing at the internet host responsible for serving the audio file byte payload.  

This last entity in the chain is what we are interested in for this analysis.  Bandwidth costs are still non-trivial for hosting
providers, hence most of them use a third-party content delivery network (CDN) to minimize this cost, and also to provide lower-latency
global distribution.

We started with our universe of _every single new podcast episode published_ (about 1.8 million in May 2025), and mapped the
underlying host of the last entity in the request chain to a known CDN or network provider.  We were able to identify the underlying
network for 99.96% of the universe.

First, a quick chart of the top podcast CDNs over time, based on share of new episodes every month.

{{< a "https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" "Amazon Cloudfront" >}} and {{< a "https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/" "Cloudflare" >}} are the clear top two CDNs of new podcast episodes.

Analysis by [John Spurlock](https://twitter.com/johnspurlock)

Thanks to the [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/) and other sources, for giving us signals of when 
to check for new episodes in public podcasts.

Also thanks to the [Open Podcast Analytics Working Group](https://github.com/opawg) for maintaining a list of media url patterns and analytics services patterns.
We've incorporated these patterns along with some of our own to come up with the host and analytics service identification and metadata for this ranking.

And thanks to folks working at various networks to help us identify each one as accurately as possible.
